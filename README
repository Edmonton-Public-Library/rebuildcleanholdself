Project Notes
-------------

Instructions for Running:
./rebuildcleanholdshelf.sh

Product Description:
Bash shell script written by Andrew Nisbet for Edmonton Public Library, distributable by the enclosed license.

This script was required when the schedule for the clean hold list was acidendfdtally deleted.
This script was required when the schedule for the clean hold list was accidentally deleted, 
then the wrong clean hold list was run that cancelled the holds but didn’t create a hold list 
report. To fix that I had to go to history logs for the holds that were cancelled when the 
‘expire available holds’ ran. 

The report compiles to EPL’s format spec for label printing and produces a report for every branch 
in the policy table. In the case of a closed branch the produced list may be empty.

The script assumes that the information can be recovered today’s history file. If that isn’t the case 
check the comments in the file and adjust accordingly. Also for an additional check, the time of 
‘the expire available holds’ report is hard-coded, for the standard time.
